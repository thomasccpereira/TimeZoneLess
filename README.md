# TimeZoneLess
On 2019 October I moved to Portugal because of work, but I have kept some freelancer projects in Brazil. When I need to schedule a meeting with someone of those freelancer projects, I always need to calculate what time the meeting would be in Brazil. The opposite also happens, I am in Brazil for vacation and need to book a call in Portuguese time.
